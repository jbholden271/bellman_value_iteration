# bellman_value_iteration
Python implementation of Bellman Value Iteration on a grid-based MDP. Can be extended to other graphs through the modification of the neighbor functions.

Currently performs value iteration on the MDP specified in __main__. 
If there is an interest, I could adapt this to accept command line arguments or read from a JSON file.
